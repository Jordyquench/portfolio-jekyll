						The design and creation of an icon set is the first of two sections to this project. The icon set had be vector based (i.e. created in Adobe Illustrator, Sketch or any other vector-based programme). The final output should be appropriate to the approach you have taken – SVGs, JPGs, PNGs, GIFs, a combination of these, or all four. </p>
						<p>With the digital product (icons) in place, I needed to design and build a website to show them off to the best of their ability. The website design should be appropriate to the visual approach taken for your icon set.</p>
						<p>
							Currently the website is in progress.

				<p>The first thing I did when starting this project was drew out a mindmap, the project brief was quite open so I needed to narrow down my options. I came up witht the first idea of doing bottle icons using this method. </p>

				<p>I decided for my idea to stick with the bottle concept but instead of going for something like alcoholic drinks or any drinks I would go for clothing brands. It is something a bit different, I came up with the idea just from doing out a mind map and already sort of having the idea for the bottle concept.  </p>
				<p>
					Originally I couldn’t get them to look good because I was just sticking to a flat design but once I decided to add some texture I fell like it was for the better, I was really happy with the way they turned. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I still intent to create some more and I also want to add some form of background to each bottle. I was also thinking of creating something to showcase them all in at once, maybe like a vending machine or example.

				<p>After the short feedback session I talked about in my last post these are the six icons I created.  </p>
				<p>Instead of the clothing brand idea I went for drinks from different cities around the world. I have kept all of the bottles the same for some consistency but that is one thing I might like to change. I will see what people think during the group critique today.</p>
