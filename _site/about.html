					<p>Hi there, my names Jordan Gault and i'm currently studying BDES (HONS) Interaction design at the Belfast school of art. </p>
					<p>
					I have always had a passion for design in all aspects, everything from UI and UX to branding and illustraion. But all ideas have to stem from something and I have the capabilities to come up with forward thinking ideas and that all comes from things like concepting and prototyping. these give me the ability to have an open mind when thinking of design 
					</p>
					<p>
					I also see myself as a storyteller, all design is telling a story, with the right concept and tools your story can be brought to life in unique and informative ways.
